:summary:  On completing this section you should be able to calculate
    the effect on the signal to noise ratio of DSB-AM with synchronous
    detection 
:outcomes: 
    : `Noise in Continuous-Wave Systems`_:  1/2


We wish to compare  `\mbox{SNR}_o`:math: with  `\mbox{SNR}_i`:math: . It
is common to define a  *figure-of-merit* for noise performance as the
ratio  `\mbox{SNR}_o/\mbox{SNR}_i`:math: . Care must be taken as there
are several different measures of  `\mbox{SNR}_i`:math: .
