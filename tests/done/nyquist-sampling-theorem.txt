  Nyquist Sampling Theorem

From what we have learn't in the tutorial on modulation basics we know
that if we sample a signal at regular instants in time we are going to
produce a periodic spectrum. Nyquists theorem is concerned with
knowing how often we sample the signal to that we can reproduce it
witout distortion. If we have a signal strictly bandlimited to
bandwidth `W`:math: and at regular intervals seperated by `T`:math:
seconds (rate `1/T`:math) then the resulting spectrum is going to be
copys of the spectrum seperate by `1/T`:math: Hz as shown in the
`Nyquist Sampling Theorem Figure`_.

Note that because we are modulating the original signal we see its
whole double sided spectrum of width `2W`:math:copied at frequency
intervals of `1/T`:math: Therefore we see that if `T \le 1/(2W)`:math:
these multiple copies of the signal spectrum are completed separated,
and we could filter out one to regenerate the original signal without
distortion. However if we sample at too low a rate, `T > 1/(2W)`:math:
then we see that there is overlap between the copies in the sampled
spectrum and there would be distortion in the recovered
signal. Therefore we can state the requirements for sampling, the
*Nyquist Sampling Theorem* as follows:

.. important:: A band-limited signal of finite energy, which has no
   frequency components higher than `W`:math: " Hz is completely
   described by sampling values of the signal at instants of time
   separated by `1/2W`:math: seconds.

If we do not satisfy this criterion we cannot recover the original
signal. In particular we may see frequency components which do not
exist in the original signal. This is called *aliasing*. For example
if we have a 4 kHz input signal and sample at a rate of only 5 kHz we
will see frequency components at (5+4)=9kHz which is removed by a low
pass filter and at (5-4)=1kHz which isn't i.e. we will see a 1kHz
signal after low pass filtering a 4kHz signal sampled at only 5kHz .

An example, which you may see in the laboratory, is that when using a
digital sampling oscilloscope which has too low a sample rate
(i.e. with a low time base set) and we look at high frequencies. We
may actually see low frequency aliased signals which are not present
at the input to the oscilloscope. Care must therefore be taken when
using such instruments - in particuar if the frequency of the signal
you are measuring changes as you change the timebase (sample rate)
then it is probably oscilloscope aliasing that you are seeing.

                t+0.7) is to be sampled periodically and reproduced from these
                sample values. How many sample values must be stored
                to reproduce 1 sec of this waveform.
     :feedback: The frequency of this waveform is `omega`:lisp:\/2
                `\pi`:math: = `(format nil "~,3F" (* 2 n))`:lisp: Hz .
                We require (from Nyquist sampling 
                theorem) at least 2 samples per period, so the sample
                frequency must be `answer`:lisp: Hz.
