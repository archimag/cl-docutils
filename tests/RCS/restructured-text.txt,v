:Abstract: A description of formatting rules for articles and reviews

reStructuredText_ is plaintext that uses simple and intuitive
constructs to indicate the structure of a document. These constructs
are equally easy to read in raw and processed forms.

Simple, implicit markup is used to indicate special constructs, such
as section headings, bullet lists, and emphasis. The markup used is as
minimal and unobtrusive as possible. Less often-used constructs and
extensions to the basic reStructuredText syntax may have more
elaborate or explicit markup. 

Although originally designed for writing documentation for the Python
programming language reStructuredText is applicable to documents of
any length and is ideal for enable user defined formatted content for
a web site. 

Please read `A ReStructuredText Primer`_ and the `Quick
reStructuredText`_ user reference to learn about the various
constructs that are available. There are a few differences relating to
how it is used in this peer review system compared to the user
reference manuals which deal with stand alone documents which I detail
below.

Document Titles and Document Info
---------------------------------

In the peer review system the document title is entered separately
from the document body text, and information about each article is
automatically generated. A title element at the start of
the entry starts the first section of the entry and does not give the
title.

Unresolved Links
----------------

reStructuredText allows for linking between sections and linking to
external urls. In the peer review system, a link to a name not
resolved in the article will be considered to be a link to the article
with that name as its title inside the peer review system. If the
article doesn't exist then it will be a link to create an article of
that title. This makes it easy to link between articles, and to
include inside your references to articles which need to be written.

Images
------

Uploaded images may be referred to in your articles using the `image`
explicit markup. The name given for the image should match the name
given in the list of images you have uploaded for the article. It is
required that your provide alternate text for each image.

Mathematical Expressions
------------------------

As an extension to the reStructured text syntax mathematical
expression may be entered using the math explicit role for in line
mathematics or the equation explicit directive for stand-alone
mathematical expressions. Mathematical expressions must be written in
LaTeX macros and must include the appropriate environment
components. You should use the LaTeX environments which do not include
equation numbering. These expressions are automatically converted to
images for display on the page For example we have an in line
`$\pi$`:math: symbol entered as ```$\pi$`:math:``, and a famous equation

.. equation::

        \[\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{8 \pi^2
        m}{h^2} \left(E - V\right)\Psi = 0\]

which was written as

| .. equation::
|    
|    \[\frac{\partial^2 \Psi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{8 \pi^2 m}{h^2} 
|      \left(E - V\right)\Psi = 0\]
